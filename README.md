🔗 Linka – Interactive Dashboards, Zero Coding
Linka is a full-stack data visualization platform that lets users turn raw data into interactive, customizable dashboards — with zero programming required.

Whether you're a developer, data analyst, project manager, or educator, Linka simplifies the entire workflow: upload → design → deploy.

🌟 Features
Drag-and-Drop Dashboard Builder
Intuitive UI to arrange charts, tables, and filters without writing a line of code.

Supports Multiple File Formats
Upload .csv, .json, or .xml data files for instant visualization.

Real-Time Filtering
Apply advanced filters (range, text, category, date) that reflect changes live on dashboards.

Pre-Built & Blank Templates
Start from scratch or choose from curated templates to get up and running quickly.

Secure Google Drive Integration
User files are stored safely on their own Google Drive, while Linka keeps only essential metadata.

Deployment Options

Instantly deploy dashboards as a live hosted URL

Or download a complete .zip package with everything needed to self-host

Version Control
Save multiple versions of your dashboard to experiment without losing work.

🧠 Why Linka?
Most visualization tools are powerful, and painfully overcomplicated. Linka bridges the gap between design and deployment, letting users build dashboards in one place without switching tools, learning complex software, or worrying about file security.

Compared to Tableau or Miro, Linka focuses on usability, privacy, and developer-friendly deployment.
